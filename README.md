# nextjs-evaluation

This is to evaluate nextjs and it's documentation

## Jupiter's conclusion

**About Next.js as an option**

Next.js optimizes your application for performance by ensuring static html is generated on initial loads.

This is done through pre-rendering to which there are different approaches (Static, SSR). Simply means that instead of having an empty page which is then hydrated, it generally is already populated and eventually hydrated for SSR types.

This also makes it for SEO to find your page very effectively. If you're developing a service that is B2C this is a good option as you want speed and SEO rankings plays a big factor.

**About Next.js documentation**
The documentation was fine, it's not so clear and alot can be improved on such as. Clearer examples, More organized steps, Refactored code instead of refactoring it at the very last step, Inline documentation and highlight concepts.

For a beginner this might be a challenging read as it's all over the place. It focuses more on concepts so that is acceptable. As for Gatsby.js documentation. That is impeccable and is very very beginner friendly
